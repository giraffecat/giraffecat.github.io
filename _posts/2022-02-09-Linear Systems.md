## Linear Systems

#### 1. Introduction

One dimensional phase spaces the flow is extremly confined——all trajectories are forced to move monotonically or remain constant. In higer-dementional phase spaces, trajectories have much more room to maneuver.



#### 2. Definitions and examples.

A two dimensional linear system is a system of the form 
$$
\vec{x} = ax + by\\
\vec{y} = cx + dy
$$
If we use boldface to denote vectors, this system can be written more compactly in matrix form
$$
\vec{x} = Ax \\where \ A = \left[ \begin{matrix} a &b \\ c &d\end{matrix} \right] \ and \ x = \left[ \begin{matrix} x \\ y \end{matrix}\right]
$$
if x1 and x2 are soultions, then so is any linear combination c1 * x1 + c2 * x2
